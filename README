1. big_O
a big O notation complexity estimator in Python. It 
use run-time empirical way to determine complexity.
See "Analysis of algorithms" on wikipedia to check
the drawback of it. -- My first python code

2. multi-threading-quicksort
real cross-platform multi-threading quicksort, but 
who need this. boring!

3. multi-threading-mergesort
similiarly...so I coded shoddily this time :P

4. knapsack
multi-threading as well. 0-1 knapsack problem. see
"Knapsack problem" on wikipedia. I did not code it 
well.

*5.tsp
travelling-salesman problem. not implemented yet.

6. hashtable
a simple implementation of hashtable

7. dijkstra
a simple sample. no magic.

*8. a-star
not implemented yet.

*9. n-ary
a implementation of n-ary tree. not implemented yet.

10. red-black-tree
red-black tree is a self-balancing tree. I just
gave a try. Check 'reb-black tree' on wikipedia
and understand properties, insert and delete 
cases.

*11. splay-tree
not implemented yet.

12. AVL-tree
simpler than red-black tree. see 'avl tree' on 
wikipedia as well. may contains some bugs, I don't 
know :)
